## Gatsby Résumé

Single-page static résumé site, built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Please fork and customize (or not). I do hope you find it helpful. Improvements are welcome!


### Getting Started

* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run develop` to start a hot-reloading development server
* Copy `src/data/contact.md-sample` to `src/data/contact.md` and fill in with your details
* Copy `src/data/companies/acme.md-sample` a few times and fill in work history (one company per file). One of the goals of this project is to fit on a single page PDF, so don't go overboard


### Publish

Once you are happy with your résumé, run `npm run build` to compile all assets to `public`. Copy the `public` directory to any static host (I like Netlify) and you're done!

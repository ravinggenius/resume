  %header About Me

  %section
    %p I have always been fascinated with programming, looking for an opportunity to build a career with this passion. In the mean time, I have deployed several websites using open source web frameworks for friends and family, and even written programs for my graphing calculator. I have always tried to keep myself informed on the latest technologies. For the past several years I have run various GNU/Linux distributions, in addition to supporting and troubleshooting Windows. I have system and network configuration experience (both personal and professional), and I am the first person many of my friends and coworkers turn to when faced with a computer challenge, be it Windows-related, software issues or hardware configuration.

      %p.description I have worked on many projects while at Cisys, most of which are for large enterprise-level clients. As the resident web standards guru, I am the go-to guy for all things CSS and HTML. Most of the products I have built have been non-public, client-specific, but some of the public sites are highlighted above. Lately I have been working on a SharePoint based service application. I design and build (normalized) databases and high-quality web applications.

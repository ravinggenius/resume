  %h2 About Me

  %p I have always been fascinated with programming, looking for an opportunity to build a career with this passion. In the mean time, I have deployed several websites using open source web frameworks for friends and family, and even written programs for my graphing calculator. I have always tried to keep myself informed on the latest technologies. For the past several years I have run various GNU/Linux distributions, in addition to supporting and troubleshooting Windows. I have system and network configuration experience (both personal and professional), and I am the first person many of my friends and coworkers turn to when faced with a computer challenge, be it Windows-related, software issues or hardware configuration.

  %div{ :class => 'section fluent' }
    %h3 XHTML | CSS

    %p{ :class => 'description' } Can quickly and easily create well-structured, %em semantic%/em  markup with a commanding use of the good tags.
    %p{ :class => 'description' } Though I am no graphic designer, I am fully capable of executing other people's layouts. I have become the reference guide for any questions about valid XHTML and CSS.

  %div{ :class => 'section fluent' }
    %h3 C# | Visual Basic | .NET

    %p{ :class => 'description' } I have been using C# and VB.NET for two years (mostly C#). During that time I have pushed myself to learn more and have become quite comfortable developing with C# and .NET in general.

  %div{ :class => 'section proficient' }
    %h3 Ruby

    %p{ :class => 'description' } Recently started learning this. I have been working on some projects, mostly with Rails, and I have more planned. Ruby is such an elegent and expressive language, I would like for it to be my primary breadwinner. I have direct experience with Rails, Merb and Sinatra.

  %div{ :class => 'section proficient' }
    %h3 JavaScript

    %p{ :class => 'description' } jQuery has really introduced me to JavaScript. I wasn't much interested in JavaScript until recently when I had a real need for it. Now I am going through a book to learn more.

  %div{ :class => 'section proficient' }
    %h3 SQL

    %p{ :class => 'description' } Very comfortable with the basics, such as designing normalized tables and selecting exactly the data I need. I have some experience with more advanced features like stored procedures. Experienced with MySQL, MSSQL and Sqlite.

  %div{ :class => 'section fluent' }
    %h3 PHP

    %p{ :class => 'description' } Cut my Object-Oriented teeth on PHP. Now I can do anything with it that is required. I coded a nice MVC framework for work with PHP, but it never got used.

    %p{ :class => 'description' } The current design was done by an outside consultant. When I was given responsibility to maintain it, I streamlined the markup, solidified the styles and ported the existing (multiple) flavors of JavaScript to jQuery.

    %p{ :class => 'description' } When I started work on this site, it was a tangled mess of Dreamweaver-generated spaghetti code and no external style sheets. I converted it to (almost) valid, semantic markup and extracted the styles into separate files. Also hooked into a third-party payment service.

    %h3 CISYS: Developer

    %span 2007.10 - present
    %p{ :class => 'description' } I have worked on many projects while at Cisys, most of which are for large enterprise-level clients. As the resident web standards guru, I am the go-to guy for all things CSS and HTML. Most of the products I have built have been non-public, client-specific, but some of the public sites are highlighted above. Lately I have been working on a SharePoint based service application. I design and build (normalized) databases and high-quality web applications.

    %h3 Presentation Strategies: Developer

    %span 2007.11 - 2008.11
    %p{ :class => 'description' } Shortly after Cisys hired me, they contracted me to a partner/vendor. My time at PStrat was spent supporting existing projects and building new products. Most things I worked on were internal or had set expiration dates.

    %p{ :class => 'description' } Address and prepare letters and postcards for bulk mail. Cut paper, run deliveries, collate, hole punch and make computer recommendations. Built a database-driven web application using PHP for one of our larger clients. (See Novartis eCatalog above.) Extra features and polish were left undone due to time and budget constraints.

			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>I have always been fascinated with programming, looking for an opportunity to build a career with this passion. In the mean time, I have deployed several websites using open source web frameworks for friends and family, and even written programs for my graphing calculator. I have always tried to keep myself informed on the latest technologies. For the past several years I have run various GNU/Linux distributions, in addition to supporting and troubleshooting Windows. I have system and network configuration experience (both personal and professional), and I am the first person many of my friends and coworkers turn to when faced with a computer challenge, be it Windows-related, software issues or hardware configuration.</p>

				<h3>XHTML | CSS</h3>

				<p class="description">Can quickly and easily create well-structured, <em>semantic</em> markup with a commanding use of the good tags.</p>
				<p class="description">Though I am no graphic designer, I am fully capable of executing other people&apos;s layouts. I have become the reference guide for any questions about valid XHTML and CSS.</p>

			<div class="section fluent">
				<h3>C# | Visual Basic | .NET</h3>

				<p class="description">I have been using C# and VB.NET for two years (mostly C#). During that time I have pushed myself to learn more and have become quite comfortable developing with C# and .NET in general.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section proficient">
				<h3>Ruby</h3>

				<p class="description">Recently started learning this. I have been working on some projects, mostly with Rails, and I have more planned. Ruby is such an elegent and expressive language, I would like for it to be my primary breadwinner. I have direct experience with Rails, Merb and Sinatra.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section proficient">
				<h3>JavaScript</h3>

				<p class="description">jQuery has really introduced me to JavaScript. I wasn&apos;t much interested in JavaScript until recently when I had a real need for it. Now I am going through a book to learn more.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section proficient">
				<h3>SQL</h3>

				<p class="description">Very comfortable with the basics, such as designing normalized tables and selecting exactly the data I need. I have some experience with more advanced features like stored procedures. Experienced with MySQL, MSSQL and Sqlite.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section fluent">
				<h3>PHP</h3>

				<p class="description">Cut my Object-Oriented teeth on PHP. Now I can do anything with it that is required. I coded a nice MVC framework for work with PHP, but it never got used.</p>

			<h2>Work Experience</h2>

			<div class="section">
				<h3>CISYS: Developer</h3>

				<span>2007.10 - present</span>
				<p class="description">I have worked on many projects while at Cisys, most of which are for large enterprise-level clients. As the resident web standards guru, I am the go-to guy for all things CSS and HTML. Most of the products I have built have been non-public, client-specific, but some of the public sites are highlighted above. Lately I have been working on a SharePoint based service application. I design and build (normalized) databases and high-quality web applications.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section">
				<h3>Presentation Strategies: Developer</h3>

				<span>2007.11 - 2008.11</span>
				<p class="description">Shortly after Cisys hired me, they contracted me to a partner/vendor. My time at PStrat was spent supporting existing projects and building new products. Most things I worked on were internal or had set expiration dates.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section">
				<h3>Sir Speedy Cary: Mail Room Supervisor</h3>

				<span>2005.09 - 2007.10</span>
				<p class="description">Address and prepare letters and postcards for bulk mail. Cut paper, run deliveries, collate, hole punch and make computer recommendations. Built a database-driven web application using PHP for one of our larger clients. (See Novartis eCatalog above.) Extra features and polish were left undone due to time and budget constraints.</p>

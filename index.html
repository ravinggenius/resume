			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>I have always been fascinated with programming, looking for an opportunity to build a career with this passion. In the mean time, I have deployed several websites using open source web frameworks for friends and family, and even written programs for my graphing calculator. I have always tried to keep myself informed on the latest technologies. For the past several years I have run various GNU/Linux distributions, in addition to supporting and troubleshooting Windows. I have system and network configuration experience (both personal and professional), and I am the first person many of my friends and coworkers turn to when faced with a computer challenge, be it Windows-related, software issues or hardware configuration.</p>

			<h2>Geek Speak</h2>

			<div class="section fluent">
				<h3>Web Standards</h3>

				<p class="description">Whenever possible I validate against the strictest (published) XHTML. I structure markup with div tags (with semantic identifiers) and leave presentation in CSS. If necessary I will use conditional comments to target Internet Explorer with style overrides.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section fluent">
				<h3>Freedom | Open Source</h3>

				<p class="description">I am a firm believer in using free software whenever possible, and I encourage my friends to do the same. I have been happily using GNU/Linux at home for many years.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section proficient">
				<h3>git | Subversion</h3>

				<p class="description">I use git at home for personal or open-source projects and Subversion (via TortoiseSVN) at work. I much prefer git for the flexiblity it provides.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section fluent">

				<h3>XHTML</h3>

			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section fluent">
				<h3>CSS</h3>

				<p class="description">Though I am no graphic designer, I am fully capable of executing other people&apos;s layouts. I have become the reference guide for any questions about valid XHTML and CSS.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section proficient">
				<h3>SQL</h3>

				<p class="description">Very comfortable with the basics, such as designing normalized tables and selecting exactly the data I need. I have some experience with more advanced features like stored procedures. Experienced with MySQL, MSSQL and Sqlite.</p>

			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section intermediate">
				<h3>Ruby</h3>

				<p class="description">Recently started learning this. I have been working on some projects, mostly with Rails, and I have more planned. Ruby is such an elegent and expressive language, I would like for it to be my primary breadwinner.</p>
			</div><!-- .section -->

			<div class="section intermediate">
				<h3>JavaScript</h3>

				<p class="description">jQuery has really introduced me to JavaScript. I wasn&apos;t much interested in JavaScript until recently when I had a real need for it. Now I am going through a book to learn more.</p>

I was able to take it to an early beta, but then other projects got in the way. In the end I just stopped working on it; I believe the project has unfortunately remained stagnate since then.</p>
